        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I was born in 1815 and died in 1852. I eventually went on to become the logo for Major League Hacking's 2016 Season.</p>
        <p>During my life, I worked with Charles Babbage on the earliest computing devices and the predecessor to what you call software today.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Ada was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer.</p>

          <li>Computing</li>
          <li>Mathematics</li>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><h3>The Difference Engine</h3></li>
        <p>
          The Difference Engine is the first project I worked on with Charles Babbage. 
        </p>
        <li><h3>The Analytical Engine</h3></li>
        <p>
           From 1842-1843, I translated Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's proposed "Analytical Engine." 
        </p>
        <li><h3>The First Computer Program</h3></li>
        <p>
          I am credited with writing the first ever published algorithm for computing. My work has been highlighted by many scientists! In 1990, Allan G. Bromley wrote about me in an article titled <em>Difference and Analytical Engines</em>. The programming language <strong>Ada</strong>, developed by the US government, is named after me.
